        <p>Machine learning is broadly categorized into two main types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Each serves distinct purposes and is used in different scenarios.</p>
        
        <h3>What is Supervised Learning?</h3>
        <p>Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. The goal is for the algorithm to learn the mapping from input to output. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>
          Input: [Features like age, salary]
          Output: [Classification as "Eligible" or "Not Eligible"]
        </code></pre>
        <p>Popular algorithms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Linear Regression</li>
          <li>Logistic Regression</li>
          <li>Support Vector Machines</li>
          <li>Neural Networks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What is Unsupervised Learning?</h3>
        <p>Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The model identifies patterns or structures in the data without explicit supervision. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>
          Input: [Customer transaction history]
          Output: [Clusters of customers with similar purchasing behavior]
        </code></pre>
        <p>Popular algorithms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>K-Means Clustering</li>
          <li>Hierarchical Clustering</li>
          <li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</li>
          <li>Autoencoders</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Key Differences</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Aspect</th>
              <th>Supervised Learning</th>
              <th>Unsupervised Learning</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Data</td>
              <td>Labeled</td>
              <td>Unlabeled</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Objective</td>
              <td>Predict outcomes based on input</td>
              <td>Discover hidden patterns in data</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Examples</td>
              <td>Spam detection, price prediction</td>
              <td>Customer segmentation, anomaly detection</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Both supervised and unsupervised learning have unique strengths and are applied based on the nature of the data and the problem to solve. Understanding these methods is fundamental to leveraging machine learning effectively.</p>

  title: "Linear Regression in Machine Learning",
  description: "A beginner-friendly guide to understanding and implementing linear regression using Python.",
  date: "November 17, 2024",
  category: "Machine Learning",
  content: `
      <p>Linear regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning. It establishes a relationship between independent variables (inputs) and a dependent variable (output) by fitting a linear equation to the data.</p>
      
      <h3>What is Linear Regression?</h3>
      <p>Linear regression models the relationship between the input variables (X) and the output variable (y) using the formula:</p>
      <pre><code>
        y = mx + b
      </code></pre>
      <p>Here, <strong>m</strong> is the slope of the line (representing the relationship strength), and <strong>b</strong> is the intercept.</p>
      
      <h3>Python Implementation</h3>
      <p>Below is an example of how you can perform linear regression using Python and the <code>scikit-learn</code> library:</p>
      <pre><code>
        from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
        import numpy as np

        # Example dataset
        X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])  # Independent variable
        y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])          # Dependent variable

        # Create and train the model
        model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

        # Make a prediction
        prediction = model.predict([[5]])
        print("Predicted value for input 5:", prediction)
      </code></pre>
      
      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>LinearRegression()</code>: Creates the linear regression model.</li>
        <li><code>fit(X, y)</code>: Fits the model to the data (X as input, y as output).</li>
        <li><code>predict()</code>: Predicts the output for a given input.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>When to Use Linear Regression?</h3>
      <p>Linear regression is ideal for situations where the relationship between the input and output is approximately linear. It works well with smaller datasets and when interpretability is important.</p>
      
      <h3>Applications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Predicting house prices based on features like size and location.</li>
        <li>Estimating sales based on advertising budgets.</li>
        <li>Modeling stock market trends over time.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Linear regression is a simple yet powerful technique that serves as a foundation for understanding more complex machine learning models. It’s a great starting point for anyone new to data science and AI.</p>

          <p>Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts probabilities that are mapped to discrete classes.</p>
  
          <h3>What is Logistic Regression?</h3>
          <p>Logistic regression uses the <strong>sigmoid function</strong> to map predicted values to probabilities:</p>
          <pre><code>
            σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
          </code></pre>
          <p>Here, <code>z = wx + b</code> represents the linear combination of inputs and weights, and the sigmoid function ensures the output is between 0 and 1.</p>
          
          <h3>Python Implementation</h3>
          <p>Here’s an example of how logistic regression can be implemented using <code>scikit-learn</code>:</p>

            accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
            print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
          </code></pre>
  
          <h3>Explanation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><code>make_classification()</code>: Generates synthetic classification data.</li>

            <li><code>accuracy_score()</code>: Evaluates the performance of the model.</li>

          <h3>Applications of Logistic Regression</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Spam email detection.</li>
            <li>Medical diagnosis (e.g., predicting the presence of a disease).</li>
            <li>Credit risk analysis (e.g., predicting loan defaults).</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h3>Advantages and Limitations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple to implement, interpretable, and efficient for binary classification tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Assumes a linear relationship between input features and the log-odds of the target class.</li>
